    "description": "Off The Fence have been working since 1994 in the City of Brighton & Hove with three areas of the community to provide one to one care and help. \r\n   Our drop in centre for the homeless, Antifreeze offers a place where rough sleepers can chat, find a sleeping bag, wash, get clothes and food, have a haircut and receive health care treatments from specialists, such as the dentist. Antifreeze also refer clients to housing and hostels, and helps rough sleepers come off the streets. Nightly our outreach teams monitor the rough sleeper\u2019s welfare and any newcomers to the City, providing immediate information and sign posting that allows a quick exit from street life. \r\nThe Women's centre, Gateway was set up to provide a place where women facing difficult times due to abuse, mental health issues or just generally struggling could find friendship, advice and support that will enable them to change and have stability in their lives. Gateway\u2019s drop in centre offers a safe place where women can learn new skills, be listened to and referred to relevant agencies and support networks. \r\nThe Schools Team run a \u2018Building Healthy Relationships\u2019 course, helping students who have found interaction with others difficult. Lunch time clubs provide a \u2018safe space\u2019 where young people who find it hardest to deal with school life have found a place of safety. In conjunction with the head teachers we also offer one to one counselling, mentoring and a full range of professional secondary school activities."

Individuals frustrated with the inconveniences placed on them to wait at home for a delivery or tradesperson/engineers arrival can book The Home Cover Company by the hour to instead wait for them. \r\n\r\nWaiting at home causes disruptions at work, loss of earnings and time wasted. Most individuals resort to using valuable holiday, or unpaid leave - now a simple solution is in place where a short term house sitter can be used. All sitters are police checked, employed directly by us, insured and fully vetted/referenced.\r\n\r\nBusinesses and companies employees lose over 13 million days holidays each year waiting at home for deliveries and workpersons. The Home Cover Company can act as a signal of a companies investment in its staff and their well being by simply endorsing the service. Companies productivity and structures can be affected by this time away as well so the positives for both employee and employer can clearly be seen.\r\n\r\nBusinesses which rely on deliveing to customers or those that need to carry out work at the home of their customers will also benefit by either using The Home Cover Company to add value for their customer or by aiding in overcoming the difficulties associated with finding a convenient time for both parties.\r\n\r\nThe Home Cover Company also will enable private landlords to use the service for enabling all their access needs. So when the landlord can not be at the home then The Home Cover Company can.",
