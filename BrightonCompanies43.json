    "description": "The decision to form the FWA was made by four journalists on board a ship in the middle of the English Channel on September 22 1947. The four were returning from Brussels, where they had seen England beat Belgium 5-2 in a friendly international, and are listed as Messrs Cole, Roy Peskett, Archie Quick, and Charlie Buchanan. The latter was the most famous of the four, having been an England international before becoming a successful journalist and founding the legendary Charlie Buchan\u2019s Football Monthly.\r\n\r\nWithin a month they had formalised some of the rules and regulations for the fledging association, membership would be invitation only, to \u201cworking journalists who are accredited football correspondants for newspapers and agencies.\u201d Headquarters were to be in London with the initial membershp fee set at five guineas for the first year, and two guineas annually thereafter \u2013 with an FWA tie included!\r\n\r\nMembership of the Football Writers Association has continued to grow steadily, to around 400 with regional hubs in the north-west, north-east, Midlands and London. With the changes in modern-day journalism, FWA members now come from more diverse backgrounds rather than the once traditional newspaper reporter.\r\n\r\nThe Association has also needed to develop quickly in recent years, with on-line voting for Footballer of the Year now also available to members, while in 2011 the FWA relaunched our website to incorporate new social media platforms all of which help improve communication.\r\n\r\nWe remain proactive in taking up members issues with both clubs as well as the Barclays Premier League and Football League, whether it be over disputed access or press facilities, and the FWA also acts to guide clubs who are looking to redevelop their own stadia, with recent improvements at Brighton a case in point.\r\n\r\nThe FWA continues to openly recruit new members and welcomes any input as to how to make covering the beautiful game a smooth working environment for all.",
