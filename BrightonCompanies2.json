It sets out to stimulate, educate and entertain a wide audience by providing a showcase for diverse art forms.\r\n\r\nIt takes place every May and for the second time, it is a 4-week festival in 2014 (3 May \u2013 1 June) to include the summer half-term week. Brighton Fringe has grown out of and is inspired by home-grown creativity: more than 50% of events are put on by artistic companies based in Brighton & Hove. In 2013, it had 734 individual events, 176 free events, 3654 performances at 185 venues.\r\n\r\nIt is also a completely open access festival, which means anyone can put on an event and be included in the brochure and website listings on payment of a fee. By definition, Brighton Fringe can include any art form. No artistic judgment or selection criteria are imposed on participants, enabling the development of both new and established work to attract fresh audiences, press and promoters."
