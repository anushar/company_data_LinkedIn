It is published annually in 9 regional editions. Each book is packed with a multitude of significant discounts (2 for 1, 25% off, etc) for the best local leisure, entertainment and dining establishments.\r\n\r\nThe Invitation Book and all associated products are produced by Invitation Media Ltd., with head offices based in Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe company was set up in 2003 by publishers Scott Davidson, Sam Oliphant, Dougal Templeton and Jo Kennedy, with the aim of raising over \u00a31 million for good causes in every region that has an Invitation book. A secondary target was to have a book established in every major city and region throughout the UK and in 2008 there were books in the following areas:\r\n\r\nBristol, Bath & West \r\nCoventry & Warwickshire \r\nBirmingham, Solihull & West Midlands \r\nCardiff, Newport & South Wales \r\nNottingham & Derby \r\nThe Black Country \r\nIn 2009, the following editions are available:\r\n\r\nSouthampton & Portsmouth \r\nBrighton, Hove & West Sussex \r\nReading, Oxford & The Thames Valley \r\nAs with anything new, it does take time for people to get used to the idea that you really can buy \u00a31,000's worth of fantastic offers and savings for less than \u00a330\u2026 but believe us, there are no catches, no hidden costs or prohibitive terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nWe would love to claim this as an original concept. But like all great ideas, it's inspired by others. There are many similar books around the world but it's 'Entertainment' founded in Detroit, USA by Hughes and Sheila Potiker in 1962, which is the most successful. It's now published in more than 200 markets across Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Asia with more than 8 million books sold in 2004. As well as each book delivering $1,000's in voucher and dining savings, it also works as a community fundraiser - $90 million was raised last year for local good causes from the sale of USA 'Entertainment' books alone.\r\n\r\nHaving recently moved to larger offices in Bristol and with a dedicated and hardworking team, Invitation Media Ltd. continues to expand its client database of members, discount promotion partners and fundraisers, always with the clear aim of helping make a difference in the local community.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the book, or ways in which we can help you, why don't you make an appointment and come have a coffee and chat, we would be more than happy to see you."
