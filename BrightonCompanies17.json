She comes to the stage with the vibrancy of youth and the wisdom of the ages. She captivates her audiences and has them rolling in the aisles with her unorthodox and irreverent look at growing up in the Midwest, surviving the free sex and drug culture of the \"60's & '70's and being over fifty in our youth oriented society. People of all ages respond to her well rounded comedy and clever audience repartee. When Sandra leaves the stage the audience clamors for more and they know \"age is just a state of mind\".\r\n\r\nYou've seen her throughout the Bay Area - Rooster T Feathers, Tommy Ts, Pepperbelly's, Wharf Room Comedy, Comedy Off Broadway to name a few. She's performed solo comedy and theater shows in the Edinburgh, Scotland and Brighton. England Fringe Festivals. She produces and hosts \"Comedy Night\" in Vallejo.",
