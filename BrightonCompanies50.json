    "description": "Shebang is a light blue homemade zine crammed with music features, travel guides, artist profiles, craft and any other interesting goings-on that catch our eye! We believe that the simple things in life should be celebrated and shared; the new favourite record you've found for pennies in a charity shop, the cake recipe your nan passed on or the gig last night that made your heart skip... \r\n\r\nFed up of music and pop culture magazines selling more of a rock 'n' roll lifestyle than rock 'n' roll spirit, Shebang was created by Liv from paper scraps and glue in her bedroom. Despite spending a few afternoons photocopying and drawing up plans, Shebang never really took off until Liv moved in with graphic designer Lynsey a few years later, who helped to give the zine a makeover and turned it into a professionally printed mag. The zine now operates between Derbyshire (where Lynsey lives) and London (where Liv is now based), though it's roots will always be Falmouth in Cornwall and Brighton, where the first two issues were made.\r\n\r\nWe're not elitist with who we include in our pages; lesser-known bands as well as those currently courting the limelight lean against each page, and unknown artists and designers share their inspirations amid pretty illustrations and photographs. We also don't care about gender or labels, and just want to share the best bands and interesting creations, old and new, with others.",
