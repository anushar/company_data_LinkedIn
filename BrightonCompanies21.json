    "description": "CS Partners is a company composed of experienced educational service providers. We are a hands on, service oriented company made up of educators with over 200 combined years of experience in public schools, who have been working for charter schools in Michigan from the beginning! The CS Partners staff has been intimately involved with the formation and ongoing operation of Charyl Stockwell Academy in Hartland and Brighton, FlexTech High School in Brighton, Crescent Academy  in Southfield and nine other charter schools and two day care centers. Since their inception, these schools have consistently maintained rising enrollment, balanced budgets and boast effective school reform programs.\r\n \r\nOur focus is educational reform. We believe that educational service providers should be led by professional educators with experience in multiple forms of education. We also believe that a particular school reform or school model is not as important as professional leadership and the use of research-tested methods and structures. We believe that professional educators know how to be successful in teaching children, but they need to escape the oppressive bureaucracy of the traditional system. With that in mind we have created a School Services Team to assist our school leaders in every aspect of school operations from curriculum, assessment, school climate and culture, special education, leadership development and support, compliance, facilities, marketing, fiscal service, human resources and more. Educators in charter schools need a clear mission, a strategy to implement that mission, the freedom to work, and the time needed to focus on students, teachers and parents. It\u2019s our job as educational service providers to help them every step of the way.\r\n \r\nWe are a results-driven management firm, made up of highly regarded educators from the traditional and charter school systems. Our size and our location allow us the flexibility to be responsive and hands-on."
