The specific applications of TexRAD include predicting early response to treatment, prognosis and tissue characterization.  Particularly in colorectal cancer, TexRAD can identify patients earlier with poor prognosis and thereby can assist clinicians to modify treatment at the early stages and so improve patient outcome.  TexRAD can be integrated easily within existing hospital imaging systems without the need for any hardware modifications and can also be accessed via a pay-per-click service.\r\n\r\nThe software can extract and quantify 'hidden' information from existing scans (CT,MIR, etc) thereby increasing considerably the depth of information given by radiological images.  \r\n\r\nIt is hoped that TexRAD will potentially support early diagnosis in other diseases and long term conditions such as dementia and other long term conditions, enabling early intervention and reducing disease progression.",
