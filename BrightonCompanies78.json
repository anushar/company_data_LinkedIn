    "description": "Stick It On started out as a humble Brighton club night with only one single mandate. 'To empower the many which had been held by the few.' Rob and Karim were frustrated, and a little bit annoyed, that DJing had become so elitist that clubland had suddenly got way too serious. Both were party DJs who loved good music whichever genre it came from. They played everywhere from pub\u2019s, small clubnights and house parties but what was clear to them was how much fun getting behind the decks and playing music to people could be.\r\n\r\nThe feeling to share this and rebel against the \u2018Superstar DJ\u2019 phenomenon, that at the time, was sweeping the nation inspired them to become the antithesis of all of what that stood for.   Together they put on their first clubnight, essentially to a bunch of their friends, but this was the beginning of Stick It On.\r\n\r\nThe night was split into 15 minute slots for each person Stickin\u2019 It On. It was open to anyone who fancied giving it a go. All they had to do was choose some of their favourite tunes (4/5 songs) that they wished to play to rock the dancefloor.\r\n\r\nNo DJ experience is necessary as a technical helper is close on hand to guide everyone through the whole process. It gave everyone the chance to rock the dancefloor, shake what your mama gave ya and enjoy yourself \u2013 Pure and simple.\r\n\r\nThat was the start of an idea that has far exceeded everybody's expectations. Stick It On is now becoming a very popular choice for wedding entertainment and corporate events.",

From Brighton to Howell, Fowlerville to Whitmore Lake and Hamburg to Hartland, First National puts the power of local banking in your hands.  You see, this is the place we call home too.  The folks who make decisions here appreciate your history and hopes for the future because we share them too. \r\n\r\nDay to day, First National does much more than cash checks, take in deposits, issue ATM cards and make car loans. We reinvest your dollars wisely in your community. Your money helps businesses take off and grow and helps people like you buy a new home, send a child to college or live life according to your plan. No other area bank can make this claim: nine out of 10 loans are made here in Livingston County.  \r\n\r\nThe power of local banking is also evident in the more than $1 million First National has contributed to area organizations, causes and events. Add to this the hundreds of hours First National employees volunteer locally each year, and you\u2019ll understand why we think local banking is the only way to go.",
