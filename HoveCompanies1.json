Our values mean that this organisation will not simply cut and reduce services, in fact the Board of Trustees have been clear that we must prioritise any savings so that protect our direct delivery to the client group.\r\n\r\n   What we know for sure is that whatever the Big Society is, a concept that is such an important part of the Prime Ministers' thinking; it cannot be achieved without organisations like ours. Otherwise, yet again, older people and their local groups will be left behind because older people do not shout or work in `sound bites'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   The people we work with are not lonely victims they are funny, rude, outrageous and only limited by the society in which they live. If we all want them to enjoy their lives we can choose for that to happen.",
