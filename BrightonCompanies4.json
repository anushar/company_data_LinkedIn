They found the perfect spot in the cobbled lanes amongst the jewellery and antique shops of Meeting House Lane.\r\n\r\nThe Chilli Pickle gradually but inexorably gained its reputation through word of mouth. As guests returned again and again, they knew that Brighton was ready for an authentic but distinctive experience of Indian cuisine. Gathering together an expert team of chefs with specialisms in a variety of Indian regional cuisines, the Chilli Pickle's own style became increasingly defined.\r\n\r\nAfter two years at Meeting House Lane an unmissable opportunity came along: a move to the myhotel premises on the bustling Jubilee Square. The Chilli Pickle is now an established presence on the Brighton culinary trail, but with a constantly evolving and seasonal menu, will surprise seasoned aficionados of Indian cuisine and delight those having their first experience.",
