Festivals are in our blood and we are proud to provide the heartbeat of the summer.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1982, we largely created the modern music festival market in the UK. Under the name of Mean Fiddler, we took shared ownership of the Reading Festival in 1989 and took sole ownership in 1993. Since then we have built Reading into the most famous Rock show on the planet and in 1999 created a parallel event in Leeds. In 2002 we took over operational management of Glastonbury Festival and in 2007 increased the capacity of the festival to 177,500. In 2006 we launched Latitude, our fledgling music and arts festival, held in the beautiful Sunrise Coast, Suffolk Latitude is doing phenomenally well; in its second year it almost doubled capacity to 20,000 visitors and has since increased to 35,000. We also produced the annual London festivals for the GLA; Rise and St Patrick\u2019s Day until 2008. In 2009, we added Electric Picnic in Ireland and Hove Festival in Norway to our festival portfolio. In September 2009, we took majority ownership of The Big Chill Festival which took place in the grounds of Eastnor Castle in Herefordshire. In 2010 we founded Orlando Calling, our first festival in Florida."

It was the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership between an insurance agency and its market. For four generations, the Verheyen family has presided over the success of the business. The formula has always been attractive. The association with AXA Group since 2008 is the eloquent proof.\r\n\r\nSmall and welded together by unbreakable bonds of friendship and solidarity. Jean Verheyen owes the quality of its performance to short reporting lines and the excellence of its staff.
