Paul and Robyn Berry welcomed their son Patrick into the family business, who looks destined to make real estate his career for life as his father did, and his father before him.\r\n\r\nThe success of 4one4 Real Estate encouraged Paul to open a second branch in 2007 located in Brighton. With the help of well known real estate agent Damien Hollingsworth, the office has proven to be another success story, with Brighton now one of the fastest growing areas north of Hobart. 4one4 Real Estate is now a household name in the northern suburbs and Brighton communities. The organisation is known for offering creative marketing ideas matched with strong family values. This has proven to be a point of difference, other large corporate real estate agencies find difficult to match. In just five years, 4one4 Real Estate has grown from three staff at one location, to 14 staff in two locations, and is still continuing to grow.",
