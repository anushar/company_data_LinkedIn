It\u2019s also our family name. The gold rush brought the biggest boom in Denim production between 1870 and 1900.\r\n \r\nWe\u2019ve been working with Denim for over 15 years and we now feel the time has come to produce our own, all of our products are made in our own specialist workshop in Brighton, East Sussex.\r\n \r\nEach piece comes with a \u201clog book\u201d inspired by the same document from the golden age of motoring. The ideal of being built to last has long been forgotten but we are proud to be able to offer a durability guarantee with each of our products. This log book entitles the owner to a service in the first six months when any wear and tear created in this time will be repaired by hand here in the workshop. This service in no way affects the owner\u2019s statutory rights.\r\n \r\nWe use 13oz Red Selvage from Japan, red in Selvage was introduced around the 1930\u2019s to denote the highest quality. The mill we work with is family run and is over100 years old. Selvage or Self-edge is also the oldest, most authentic denim woven on the original looms.\r\n \r\nOf course you can always drop us a line for more tips or geeky history anytime, there is a handy form on this website and we\u2019ll get back to you or you can take a read of our Denim Dictionary."
