Our partnerships with these congregations are critical to our success, but we eagerly welcome people of all faiths and backgrounds who need help finding work and who desire long-term self-sufficiency. In fact, due to changing demographics in our communities, many people Daily Work serves today are new to America: immigrants from Ethiopia, Liberia and Eritrea. Daily Work continues to be primarily a volunteer-driven organization, but volunteers come from a variety of backgrounds, including many college interns who are completing field work requirements as part of their degrees.\r\n\r\nWe envision communities where all people can support and sustain themselves through work, and, as a result, take active roles in the lives of their families and neighborhoods, benefiting all. Daily Work\u2019s mission is to guide and mentor job seekers, who seek to be self-supporting by helping them prepare for, find and maintain work, enabling them to sustain themselves and their families. Currently, we provide all services at no charge by utilizing college social work interns who help job seekers access established resources, develop job seeking materials such as resumes and cover letters, and cultivate work readiness skills."
