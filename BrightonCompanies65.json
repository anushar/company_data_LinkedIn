Haileybury\u2019s commitment to small class sizes extends to all stages of schooling.   \r\n\r\n\r\nHaileybury\u2019s parallel education is an enlightened method of teaching that recognizes the diverse education needs to boys and girls. While boys and girls benefit from learning together in their early years, better educational outcomes are derived through single-gender classes in their middle and senior years. At Haileybury, boys and girls learn together until Year 4. From Year 5 to 12, boys and girls attend separate schools on the same campus.
