We encourage positive images of people from all ethnic and cultural groups and people with and without disabilities. We believe it is vital for young children to learn about different customs, religious and cultural beliefs and disabilities.\r\n\r\nBy encouraging understanding and respect of other people in our community, we hope to promote a more tolerant and harmonious society. We have recently welcomed Sudanese, Indian, Bengali, Saudi, Egyptian, Japanese, French, Bulgarian & Slovakian children as well as those of British origin.\r\n\r\nSongs, stories, food and shared festivals and customs have been explored and enjoyed by all. In such a richly diverse environment, the children experience new ideas, develop skills, gain confidence, improve communication skills, make friends and learn from each other. Most importantly, they have fun!",
