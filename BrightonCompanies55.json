Every garment and accessory is inspired, designed, manufactured, and distributed globally from our adopted country.  We work with NGOs, non-profits, small family businesses, and local women sewing out of their homes so that they may care for their children.\r\n\r\nOur suppliers set their own prices, and we have helped them to become mini-entrepreneurs \u2013 following their dreams, employing others, building businesses, opening bank accounts, and improving the quality of their lives and the lives around them.  We have supported their initiatives by encouraging them to think creatively, take chances, offer suggestions, gain computer skills, and learn English - to be a part of a newly reborn Cambodia.\r\n\r\nAnd in the process, they have helped define wanderlust, a lifestyle concept dedicated to giving girls gorgeousness, beautiful things handmade by the beautiful people of this beautiful country, beauty that easily translates to Budapest, Boston, Battambang, Brighton, or any beautiful place they call home.\r\n\r\nBeginning in February 2011, wanderlust products will also be found in more than 30 boutiques and specialty stores around the world.",
