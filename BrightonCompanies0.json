    "description": "Our Story\r\n\r\nJerry Kohl and Terri Kravitz (now Terri Kohl) \u2013 met, fell in love and started a specialty store east of Los Angeles while still in high school. They opened after classes, selling T-shirts and leather goods to their classmates. Upon graduating in 1969, they operated the store full-time.\r\n\r\nThey faced the challenge of getting merchandise delivered on time. Jerry had ideas for improving things. Coincidentally, a couple named Lee and Ginny \u2013 vendors of theirs who made belts, handbags and sandals \u2013 wanted to phase out of their business. Two years later, they decided to sell their company and move to New Zealand. Jerry bought into their company, Leegin, and began supplying specialty stores with leather goods.\r\n\r\nWhen Jerry took over Leegin, it was a men\u2019s belt manufacturer. Jerry and Terri wanted it to be a different kind of business, built from the heart by knocking on doors and personally servicing stores. Products would be created by their own designers and produced in their own factories to assure beauty and exceptional quality.\r\n\r\nThe designs evolved. Brighton began in 1985 out of the heritage of well-tailored, finely crafted men\u2019s belts. Since men\u2019s stores often had ladies\u2019 departments, Lady Brighton belts were launched in 1990. With the debut of Brighton handbags in 1993 stores were able to offer customers fine quality handbags.\r\n\r\nWallets, small leathers, timepieces, fragrances, jewelry, gifts and sunglasses followed. In 1998, the first Brighton-only store opened in the Dallas Galleria... and became a runaway success! In 1995, footwear was added\u2013 making Brighton the only product line to accessorize women from head to toe!\r\n\r\nToday there are over 160 Brighton Collectibles stores. Jerry and Terri are committed to empowering families through supporting a variety of charities."
