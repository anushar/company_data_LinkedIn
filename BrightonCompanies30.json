Individuals frustrated with the inconveniences placed on them to wait at home for a delivery or tradesperson/engineers arrival can book The Home Cover Company by the hour to instead wait for them. \r\n\r\nWaiting at home causes disruptions at work, loss of earnings and time wasted. Most individuals resort to using valuable holiday, or unpaid leave - now a simple solution is in place where a short term house sitter can be used. All sitters are police checked, employed directly by us, insured and fully vetted/referenced.\r\n\r\nBusinesses and companies employees lose over 13 million days holidays each year waiting at home for deliveries and workpersons. The Home Cover Company can act as a signal of a companies investment in its staff and their well being by simply endorsing the service. Companies productivity and structures can be affected by this time away as well so the positives for both employee and employer can clearly be seen.\r\n\r\nBusinesses which rely on deliveing to customers or those that need to carry out work at the home of their customers will also benefit by either using The Home Cover Company to add value for their customer or by aiding in overcoming the difficulties associated with finding a convenient time for both parties.\r\n\r\nThe Home Cover Company also will enable private landlords to use the service for enabling all their access needs. So when the landlord can not be at the home then The Home Cover Company can.",

In our industry perfection requires both intimate knowledge of the nutraceutical world and exacting manufacturing standards. Reflex Nutrition\u2019s sheer determination to lead the market in both innovation and quality resulted in the design and manufacture of the Reflex Science Park on the outskirts of Brighton. The two acre site provides exceptional manufacturing facilities for the production of the following full range of extremely high quality sports nutrition supplements.",
