Sinds 1998 actief onder de nieuwe naam: Allergy Therapeutics, maar als Bencard met een lange historie als onderdeel van SmithKline&Beecham (nu GSK). Het hoofdkantoor van de beursgenoteerde onderneming staat in Worthing, West Sussex, vlak bij Brighton aan de Engelse zuidkust. Allergy Therapeutics is in een hoog tempo zelfstandige vestigingen aan het opzetten in heel Europa en ver daarbuiten.\r\n \r\nEen nieuwe situatie in Nederland\r\nNa een lange periode van onduidelijkheid over de vergoeding van allergievaccins (subcutaan en sublinguaal) heeft de Inspectie Gezondheidszorg (IGZ) definitief bepaald dat voor de behandeling van allergiepatienten met immunotherapie, een geregisteerd geneesmiddel de voorkeur heeft. Dit besluit komt erop neer dat alle niet-geregistreerde producten op termijn niet meer voor vergoeding in aanmerking komen. Pollinex\u00ae heeft aangetoond bewezen effectief en veilig te zijn en is geregistreerd voor de toepassing bij allergie\u00ebn en wordt volledig vergoed door alle zorgverzekeraars.",

    "description": "H.H. Barnum Company takes great pride in its history, and a continued legacy of placing customers and employees as a priority for over 60 years. In 1946, Herb Barnum founded the company with operations focused on process control valves and instrumentation. After ten years, former World War II bomber pilot and University of Illinois alumnus Ken Koza joined Barnum as a salesman, bringing with him a relentless work ethic and experience as an engineer at industrial control and thermostat manufacturer, Honeywell.\r\n\r\nAfter quickly earning his place as a top salesman, Koza purchased 40 percent of Barnum, eventually taking on full ownership of the company following Mr. Barnum\u2019s retirement in 1975. Koza, soon joined by his sons, Ed and Ken Junior, refocused business efforts from control valves and instrumentation to the distribution of factory automation systems across multiple industries.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Ken Koza\u2019s retirement in 1988, Barnum stood poised for growth with 12 employees and an opportunity to provide manufacturers with thoughtful industrial solutions and a detailed knowledge of automation controls. Today the company proudly employs over 100 people, operating a 65,000 square foot facility in its Brighton, Michigan Headquarters and stocking offices in Cleveland, Ohio and Grand Rapids, Michigan.\r\n\r\nDedication to innovation and quality by both our valued customers and employees is the foundation on which Barnum is built, and has remained a driving force behind the company since its humble beginnings over six decades ago."

The owner, Jan Hartman, began by designing and sewing decorative banners on her dining room table, which she originally sold at local holiday fairs. In 1993 she opened a charming shop in Spread Eagle Village, selling both flags and gifts. One expansion and several years later, we had outgrown the location. In 2001, we moved across the street to our current airy two-level store on the corner of Lancaster Avenue and Conestoga Road, right across from the Strafford Farmers\u2019 Market.",
