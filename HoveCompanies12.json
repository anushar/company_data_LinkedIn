    "description": "For close on 20 years I have been buying, renovating, renting and managing property in what is now the city of Brighton & Hove. From the first flat purchased in 1991 for \u00a325,000 the portfolio has grown over the years as and when suitable investments/projects presented themselves. What started out as a single long term capital growth investment and well before \u201cbuy to let\u201d came to be fashionable, there is now a complete 01 Property Group which encompasses its own dedicated 01 Property Letting, 01 Property Maintenance and now an 01 Property Investment business. \r\n\r\n01 Property Investment Ltd was established in 2009 as a way of allowing others to share the capital growth and/or monthly income opportunities from bricks and mortar investment but without the hassle and worry. \r\n\r\nGetting a healthy return on your hard earned cash is not without its risks and generally the higher the return the higher the risk. Each and every one of us has to make our choices and decisions, but if you believe (as I do) that over the long run that sensible investment in property will provide that healthy return \u2013 come and join us.\r\n\r\nTwo products are currently available depending on your investment appetite:\r\n\r\nInvestment Loan - a guaranteed monthly paid high return on your money.  \r\n\r\nManaged Buy-to-Let \u2013 a full managed service with monthly income from day one and medium term capital growth (not guaranteed).",
