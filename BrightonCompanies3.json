We are a small, friendly company based in Brighton helping small and medium sized businesses make the most of social media through consultation, strategy design and training. Follow our page for useful articles, tips and ideas!\r\n\r\nRead more about how we work here: \r\n\r\n\r\nSocial media can be an intimidating landscape if you're not sure exactly what you're doing or why and we help people get to grips with it.  Without a clear strategy which is aligned with business objectives, the majority of social media efforts will not achieve anything. We take the time to establish the goals and values of your company, gather an overview of your business model, understand what resources you have, and ascertain what you hope to gain from having a social media plan in place. This and a few other simple questions will give us enough information to put together a bespoke training proposal for you.\r\n\r\nTraining could take the form of a presentation to senior executives or management on the importance of using social media. Or group training sessions with employees who are involved at various levels. Training will be relevant to your business and cover all aspects relevant to your strategy and will teach the delegates exactly what they need to know and all of the platforms and tools they need, best practice and loads of tips to help you meet your objectives!",

We manufacture instrumentation under the name Surface Analyst(TM). \r\n\r\nThe Surface Analyst is a hand-held device that measures the surface quality of most materials including composites, polymers, metals, ceramics, biologicals, and papers.  It is engineered for cost control and quality assurance on the manufacturing floor in bonding, coating, sealing and printing operations. This is accomplished by quantifying surface condition to insure proper surface preparation, or the absence of molecular level contamination prior to critical manufacturing processes. In addition to preventing product failures, the Surface Analyst embodies an enabling technology for product formulation, expanded use for adhesive bonding, and rapid data gathering in the lab.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Surface Analyst, Brighton Technologies can advise on new ways many operations can use adhesives or coatings.",
