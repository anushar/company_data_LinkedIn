The label picked up glowing praise early on for it\u2019s lo-fi folk, with albums by The R.G.Morrison, Thirty Pounds of Bone and Birdengine receiving national attention. Our first compilation \u2018The Drift Collective\u2019 gave the whole roster a showcase, highlighting (much as with the shops ethos) how Electronica, Folk, Indie and Americana can not only sit next to one another, \r\nSubsequent albums from Matt Eaton, Tandy Hard and Mary Hampton also won the label many plaudits and more importantly lots of new friends. We were very proud to work with Muddy Suzuki and Thomas White (on his first solo album outside of Electric Soft Parade and Brakes) and also Scotland\u2019s Le Reno Amps, all three groups showing how far we\u2019d moved from the \u2018folk label\u2019 Drift had been billed as.\r\n\r\nAnother little miracle courtesy of Devon via Brighton\u2019s always excellent Drift Records - Time Out\r\n\r\nInventive, imaginative and different; long may they collect together - Record Collector\r\n\r\n\u201cDown at the roots of British folk, strange things continue to stir.

The key objectives of the business are to promote the work of local craft based designer makers, forge links within the local community and create a resource centre for designers as well as the general public. I know that this kind of space is rare in Brighton. \r\n\r\nThe idea of building a community of creatives within a shared space is really exciting and the additional support services would make it ideal for someone who wants to start a new business and not be tied in to lengthy rents/leases etc...\r\n\r\nThe space is now ready for use having been cleared and cleaned up. We already  have a web designer, a furniture designer and a photographer using the space as well as  interest from a broad range of creatives including a  knitwear designer, furniture designer/maker and a printer - which is really encouraging.",
