    "description": "It's a twice-monthly developer meetup in Brighton with a focus on JavaScript and related technologies. Async has seen a remarkable input from the community, with local and visiting speakers talking about their technical discoveries and passions.\r\n\r\nMany of our sessions focus on specific subjects, such as using JavaScript on the server, or developing mobile web apps. Other meetups are more open and collaborative, e.g. show n\u2019 tells and hack nights. We put as much emphasis into learning new things, as into coming together as a community and making connections that are useful in our daily work as web developers.\r\n\r\nEntry is free. Each meetup is followed by an evening social nearby.",

We are experts in call handling and professional virtual receptionist solutions. Our virtual receptionist solutions offer businesses, regardless of their size, an alternative way of handling their telephone calls and unlike the majority of our competitors we charge per call not per minute so you are not caught out with large unexpected bills.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the difference a team of enthusiastic and motivated staff can make to customer satisfaction and ultimately retention. We are not a call centre and so our customers are not simply numbers. We instead are a series of small teams each dedicated to a limited number of customers. As a result, each of our customers and their callers receive an outstanding personal service. Our customers also have their own account manager who is on hand to discuss and address their virtual receptionist needs whenever they want.\r\n\r\nOur staff (who we call virtual receptionists) are professional and skilled call handling agents who answer inbound telephone calls in your business name as an overflow or outsourced service. Our virtual receptionists can offer far more than just a message taking service. Other services include (but are not limited to): call patching, appointment booking, order taking, outbound calling, etc...",
