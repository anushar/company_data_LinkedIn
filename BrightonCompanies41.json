The week-long programme of events came about in partnership with local businesses & creative communities as well as publishing houses (most notably the Ginger Moo Gallery, Crawley Library, Waterstone\u2019s County Mall, Crawley Borough Council and The Hawth as well as Headline and Pan MacMillan). \r\n\r\nWe challenge the notion that Crawley is not a place where one would find a literary festival and for the residents of the town to have access to something that is more often associated with cities such as Brighton or Chichester. Our aims are for the festival to be to be inclusive, vibrant and varied. The programme includes talks, panel discussions, workshops, competitions, art exhibitions and live music. We chose to name the programme WORDfest so as to be expansive in the events we can offer and so engage and interest as much of the local community as possible.\r\n\r\nWe also aim to support local creatives and bring in talent from elsewhere so that experiences and expertise could be shared amongst the participants as well as those attending from the public.\r\n\r\nWORDfest 2012 runs from Saturday 24th of March until Thursday 5th of April.",

Since then the company has gone from strength to strength, dodging the obstacles (and wrenches!) that inevitably occur with any new venture. Today, Dodgeball UK run a variety of social leagues, tournaments, company sessions, parties, singles events and much more, all around the UK.\r\n\r\nDodgeball UK\u2019s main office is in London\u2019s Canary Wharf, but events are by no means restricted to the capital. Dodgeball UK have organised tourneys and private sessions all over the country as far and wide as Leeds, Cardiff, Bristol, Manchester, Liverpool, Stafford, Brighton, Sheffield and other marvellous cities. \r\n\r\nThe premise behind Dodgeball UK is that people have the opportunity to do something different that is very sociable and that anyone can play. Everyone starts on a level playing field (all beginners!) and everyone can enjoy the game. Even those of you with terrible hair are allowed to play. Aren\u2019t we nice!\r\n\r\nDodgeball UK has also seen some of the most artistic, silly and inventive team \u2018kits\u2019, as well as some ludicrous team names. It\u2019s all part of the fun, and of course an integral aspect of the now legendary Apres-Dodgeball! We\u2019ve even had a few couples meet at Dodgeball UK but we hope they don\u2019t hold that against us!\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the balls aren\u2019t hard like on the film so what are you waiting for? See you at an event soon!\r\n\r\nDodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and\u2026DRINK!",

We became a Private Limited Company in 1984 and the Portsmouth premises have been relocated twice, first to New Road, Portsmouth and more recently to Claybank Road, Portsmouth where we are still trading today.\r\n\r\nDuring the late 1980's and early 1990's, four more branches were added in Fareham (which is also home to our Head Office), Petersfield, Southampton and Gosport. Further expansion saw us open branches in Littlehampton, Bognor, Chichester and Winchester. In 2007 we opened branches in Worthing, Guildford and Aldershot and in February 2008 Andover became the thirteenth branch. Branch number fourteen opened in Brighton in May 2008 and our fifteenth branch opened in Basingstoke in December 2009. In October 2010 we opened our 16th branch in Crawley which was promptly followed by our 17th branch in Reading in November that year. Slough and Croydon quickly followed in early 2011 and our 20th branch\r\nin Maidstone opened on 1st August 2011.\r\n\r\nThe founder, Mick Williams is Executive Chairman and majority shareholder, with Ray Stafford as Managing Director and Rachel Hannaford as Financial Director. Ann Williams was made a non-executive Director in May 2011.",
