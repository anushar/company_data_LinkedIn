    "description": "Brighton Financial Planning (BFP) was established in 1984 by James J. Chesterton, Jr. CFP\u00ae to provide high quality Financial Planning and Investment Advisory services to individuals. John P. Middleton, CFA, CAIA assumed ownership in 2010.\r\n\r\nBFP was established with a belief that individuals expect and require personalized attention and customized service to maximize their financial well-being. We believe boutique firms, such as ours, are better able to provide that level of care and attention. We believe long-term relationships between the client and advisor are both desirable and essential. A financial plan or investment strategy is not a singular event. Circumstances will change in unanticipated ways over time and strategies must be continually adapted to meet those challenges. Thus a long-lasting client-advisor relationship is critical to making the right adaptations.\r\n\r\nAs a boutique, we offer several desirable, beneficial attributes to individuals. Most importantly, we are an independent firm whose sole source of compensation is the fees paid by our clients. This independence provides us the freedom to make recommendations and decisions we believe are in the best interests of our clients.\r\n\r\nWe offer co-ordinated Financial Planning, Discretionary Investment Management Services and Defined Contribution Advisory Services including endowment and foundation consulting and investment management and defined contribution consulting and management.",
