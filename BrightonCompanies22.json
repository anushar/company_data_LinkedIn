    "description": "Peaker Services, Inc. (PSI) was founded in 1971 in a two-car garage in Belleville, Michigan to repair and maintain EMD diesel generators or \"Peakers\" as they are known in the utility industry. As demand for PSI's services grew, the company built and moved into larger quarters next to the two-car garage. After having to move the basketball court next to the garage, the company moved to Brighton, Michigan, approximately 30 minutes northwest of Detroit. In 1978, PSI built its \"Green Oak No. 1\" plant and office on a rural 10-acre site in Brighton. The facility was then tripled in size in 1984 to the current 45,000 sq. ft., including additonal remanufacturing and warehouse space. In 2006, PSI added the New Castle, Delaware location to service PSI's expanding East Coast market."
