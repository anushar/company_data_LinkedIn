    "description": "Yesco Electrical Supply Inc. is a locally owned and operated company that was established in 1987. Lee DeRose opened his first location in a small building on Marshall Street in Youngstown, Ohio. He used the experience he gained from working as an electrician at the General Motors Lordstown Assembly Plant and applied it to an entirely different aspect of the business - representing manufacturers of electrical supplies. Yesco serves customers in a variety of segments, from Industrial, Institutional, Residential and Contractors to Security, Alarm and Computer industries.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, Yesco moved to its current location on Marshall Street to an expanded storage facility allowing additional product to be kept in stock. Yesco currently stocks and resells 165,000 products from over 400 manufacturers. This growth was just the beginning as we have grown by an additional four locations since that time. Yesco opened its Columbiana, Ohio location in 1996, purchased the assets of the wholesale division of Bruce and Merrilee Electric Co in New Castle, Pennsylvania in 2004, and acquired the assets of Elliott Electric Supply Co and lighting showroom located in New Brighton, Pennsylvania in 2005.\r\n\r\nToday, Yesco has grown to 60 employees, maintaining over 50,000 square feet of location space, serving over 6000 customers while stocking and re-selling 165,000 products from over 400 manufacturers. Yesco's territory covers a 12 county region in Western Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio.",

    "description": "Rock Stone Bike Alley was established seven years ago by Rockford Copeland and is a workshop in Tottenham.  Individuals can come and learn how to fix, repair bikes, as well as bike maintenance.  Also it runs a social inclusion activity that called the \u2018postcode rides\u2019 where young people from different postcode areas and estates, will ride in groups from one rival postcode area to another.  Under supervision these young people will engage and meet others from these other neighbourhoods\u2019 and they eventually progress to go out and ride with each other on trips further afield to go to other estates and areas.  Every summer Rock Stone Bike Alley, assembles these young people for the annual London to Brighton Bike ride.  Another aspect of the project is to train young cyclists to become competitive bike riders for various competitions.  Many young people have gone on to cycle in 10 km cycle rides and ride for charity and compete in amateur rides throughout the UK.\r\n\r\nOur workshop carries out repairs and maintenance work sells bikes accessories, brand new and 2nd hand bikes customise bikes to your specifications.  We offer cycling instruction, coach education and training, deliver fitness training, provide sports science support & injury management, and nutritional advice, for cycling and other sports. We also offer GP refferals, and mental health support/workshops."
