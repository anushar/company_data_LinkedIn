We employ over 200 people, 50% of whom possess over 10 years' service. And while our comprehensive workshop is extremely accomplished, it's our engineering excellence that drives our business and an exceptional management skill that ensures we deliver.\r\nIn the last decade alone, we've designed, manufactured and installed structures for over 380 projects including pre-eminent buildings such as the Brighton Dome, The Guildhall, London and Wembley Arena. It's a level of expertise that places us at the forefront of the construction industry shaping, not just our track record, but landscapes across the world.\r\n\r\nWe specialise in the construction of gas-fired power stations. In fact, we're responsible for 14 of 23 built throughout the UK in the 1990s. This experience has seen us master the core skills required in the sector. And, as demand for energy grows ever more acute, leaves us ideally positioned as the next generation of power and waste to energy plants materialise. With power stations we're also able to realise our desire to work in an integrated style. We consider integration to be the ideal way for the construction industry to move forward. It requires openness, honesty and trust, qualities we've nurtured and attach great importance to.\r\n\r\nOur experience has led us to build something of a philosophy, too. We believe a correlation exists between the quality of relationship our project team, our suppliers and customers share and the quality of service and product we deliver. It means our people are of paramount importance. And given repeat business stands at over 90%, our customers must be in agreement.",

In summer months the Orchestra is Resident at Glyndebourne Festival Opera.  \r\n\r\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra is recognised as one of the world's great orchestras, and following Sir Thomas Beecham's founding tenure the ensemble's Principal Conductorship has been passed from one celebrated musician to another. The current Principal Conductor is Vladimir Jurowski.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its concert series in London, Brighton and Eastbourne, the Orchestra has an international touring schedule which in recent years has taken it to the USA, China, Taiwan, Dubai and across Europe.\r\n\r\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra has long been embraced by the recording, broadcasting and film industries. It enjoys strong relationships with major record labels and in 2005 began releasing live, studio and archive recordings on its own label CDs which are distributed worldwide and are also available as downloads. The Orchestra has broadcast regularly on domestic and international television and radio from both the concert hall and the opera house, and has worked extensively with both Hollywood and the UK film industries, recording soundtracks for blockbuster motion pictures including the Oscar-winning score for The Lord of the Rings trilogy and scores for Lawrence of Arabia, The Mission, East is East and In the Name of the Father.\r\n\r\nThe London Philharmonic Orchestra's international reputation is matched by a steadfast and unflinching commitment to the communities of its local London boroughs of Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham. The Orchestra reaches thousands through its varied and extensive programme of education work, both community and school-based."
