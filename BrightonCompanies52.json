Within six months of the first program meeting, LAHRA met the requirements for affiliation with the Society of Human Resource Management, and became its 708th chapter.  In early 2007, the chapter was designated a Superior Merit Chapter by SHRM for accomplishments during its first calendar year of existence, a distinguished honor. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAHRA prides itself on offering quality speakers at its monthly program meetings, with an emphasis on topics which are approved for HRCI recertification credits.  In addition, the organization looks for opportunities to contribute to the community through related volunteer efforts, and supports the national organization through fundraising for the SHRM Foundation.  LAHRA is closely linked with its sister chapters in Detroit, Lansing and Ann Arbor, and occasionally sponsors joint meetings or events with these chapters. \r\n\r\n\r\nLAHRA welcomes members and non-members to attend its monthly program meetings and other events.  We encourage interested professionals to submit a membership application, and to become actively involved in the organization as a volunteer.

    "description": "Wikipedia defines a Gastropub as \u201ca British term for a Public House which specializes in high quality food a step above the more basic pub grub.\" The name is a portmanteau (combination) of \u201cpub\u201d (the short form of public house) and \u201cgastro\u201d (short for gastronomy, or food-related). It was first used in 1991 when David Eyre and Michael Belbon opened a pub in Clerkenwell, London named The Eagle, that placed an emphasis on food quality not common in existing British pubs. In its simplest form, a Gastro Pub is \u201ca place with a warm, inviting pub atmosphere that serves sophisticated, yet unpretentious food.\u201d An extensive, and creative, Beer and Wine List is an integral part of the concept. \r\n\r\nWhy Victoria? \r\n\r\nMany of the pubs in London are located in close proximity to \u201cTube\u201d stops on the Metro System. The name Victoria is derived from Victoria Station, a stop that connects the Brighton and Chatham Main Lines on that system. It is also the name of the pub's Chief Experience Officer and daughter of our Proprietors. \r\n\r\nWhat is Our Menu like? \r\n\r\nThe main objective of our kitchen is to serve innovative twists on classic pub fare that stress quality and freshness with every recipe, and every ingredient. The menu items will draw from both national and international cooking traditions and will remain in harmony with the seasonal availability of high-quality ingredients.",

The two\r\nfloors above are for both work and networking - enough space to have a\r\nprivate phone call/meeting or chat over a coffee and your laptop.\r\n\r\nHow does it work? \r\nMonthly membership with 8 hours of childcare/\r\nco-working per week. These hours can be rolled on for a quarter of a\r\nyear. Hours should be booked online by midday Friday of the\r\npreceding week. If the membership allowance has been used up,\r\nmore can be purchased at an hourly rate.\r\n\r\nWho is it for? Any parent with a child under 5 years of age: freelance\r\nparents with unpredictable working hours; mothers who want a few\r\nhours to themselves in the first few months after their child\u2019s birth,\r\nbefore they think about going back to a fulltime job; mature student\r\nparents with timetables that change from term to term.\r\n\r\nBenefits? A community of like-minded families; a chance for a\r\nmother to ease herself back into work without stopping breastfeeding,\r\nfor a father to give the mother of his child a rest while still getting a\r\nchunk of work done; no more paying for nursery care when you don\u2019t\r\nneed it.",
