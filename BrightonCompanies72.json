Our first fixture at the County Ground was against Gloucestershire on 6th June 1872.\r\n\r\nThe Club won its first County Championship in 2003, which was the beginning of an era in which Sussex enjoyed prolonged success, named 'The Golden Decade'\r\n\r\nSussex had tasted one-day success in 1963, 1964, 1978 and 1986 but 'The Golden Decade' is regarded as the most successful period in the long history, with Sussex reclaiming the County Championship in both 2006 and 2007, as well as making 2006 a 'double' winning year, with the County also winning the C&G Trophy in a thrilling low-scoring final at Lord's against Lancashire.\r\n\r\nSussex also embarked on one-day success, winning the Pro40 League in both 2008 and 2009, the latter also inspiring the Club to a first Twenty20 title, beating Somerset on Finals Day at Edgbaston. \r\n\r\nWe now pride ourselves on not only delivering first class County cricket but following the 3 year redevelopment of the ground here in Hove, we now offer a wide range of first class facilities for local business and the community to utilise 12 months of the year.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Sussex CCC visit\r\nwww.sussexcricket.co.uk\r\nwww.facebook.com/sussexccc\r\nwww.twitter.com/sussexccc",
