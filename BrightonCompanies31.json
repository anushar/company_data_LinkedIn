    "description": "Liquid air is a proven energy storage technology that could play a critical role in Britain\u2019s low carbon energy future, according to a major new report from business and academic experts. The use of liquid air for grid-based energy storage could increase UK energy security, cut greenhouse gas emissions and create a new industry worth at least \u00a31bn pa and 22,000 jobs to the UK, the report found.\r\n\r\nThe report, published by the Centre for Low Carbon Futures (CLCF) and launched at a joint conference with the Royal Academy of Engineering, concludes that liquid air technologies could also significantly increase the efficiency of road vehicles, particularly in Britain\u2019s fleets of buses, vans and refrigerated lorries.\r\n\r\nThe Liquid Air Energy Network (LAEN) is the new forum for the advocacy and development of liquid air as an alternative way to harness waste and surplus energy within power and transport. As a nascent industry, connecting disparate interested parties within the emerging sector will play a key role in accelerating its development.\r\n\r\nContributors to the report include Arup, Ricardo, National Grid, Poyry, Messer Group; and academics from the Universities of Leeds, Birmingham, Strathclyde, Brighton, Queen Mary University of London and Imperial College.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about LAEN, including how to become a member, liquid air as an energy vector or to download the report please visit www.liquidair.org.uk \r\n\r\nFounding Director: Toby Peters\r\nEmail: info@liquidair.org.uk"
