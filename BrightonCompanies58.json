Originally from New Zealand, I completed my Sports Science degree, while playing age group rugby for Otago University and the Otago RFU.\t\r\n\t\t\t\tHadon Westerby - Program Director\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI then worked in, and managed the Hamilton YMCA before arriving in the UK in 2002. Since then, I have worked as a teacher at St Bede's School, teaching PE, rugby and cricket to school students. In my time there, 3 former students have gone on to play international rugby around the world. This adds to the long list of regional and international players I have worked with and coached in New Zealand.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI also worked in New York for 6 months, with Mark Griffin, setting up Play Rugby USA - a charity that teaches rugby to school students in New York, and now across the USA.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tCurrently I coach for the Harlequins rugby academy in Brighton, and for the Sussex U17 side. I am soon to complete my Level III RFU coaching qualifications.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFinally, I also work as a referee and as a RFU Coach Educator in the local area.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\tAs you can see, I am very experienced in this field, and well qualified to operate SportyCamps."

    "description": "Terre \u00e0 Terre was born, 17 years ago, out of a shared passion of two people with a mission, Amanda Powley and Philip Taylor. Classically trained as chefs and having cooked throughout the world, they wanted a platform for their innovative ideas where they could push the boundaries of traditional cuisine, while adhering to their beliefs in meat-free cooking.\r\n\r\nWhat began as a BYO with 30 covers, supported by friends, family and the local Brighton community/growers and very lovely staff, (thank you), has become one the most exciting and successful restaurants in the UK. And we\u2019re not just talking vegetarian restaurants, winning the title of 'Best for Vegetarian' - Observer Food Awards 2008 and continuously retaining the prestigious AA Two Rosettes and Michelin: \u201d Bib Gourmand\u201d awards. First and foremost it is an establishment that serves outstanding food, and the fact that you won\u2019t find meat on its menu is merely secondary.\r\n\r\nUltimately Terre \u00e0 Terre is about quality ingredients served with flair, creativity and playful exuberance. \r\n\r\nEating at Terre \u00e0 Terre will stimulate your mind as well as your taste buds and we believe it will change the way you view vegetarian cuisine forever"

Our school was opened in 1961, following the hard work and determination of the late Canon Daniel O'Hanlon, parish priest in Aldershot, with the support of local families, to ensure educational provision for Catholic families in the area.\r\n\r\nThe name All Hallows refers to all the Saints, all those who we believe have gone to be with God, and the superb sculpture above the main entrance was specially commissioned to reflect the school's name.\r\n\r\nAll Hallows has expanded ever since its opening, now serving a catchment area of some 400 square miles, and preparing to celebrate its Golden Jubilee in 2011-2012.  We provide Catholic education within the Diocese of Portsmouth, also taking a large number of pupils who live within the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. Our school is founded on 'gospel values' and subject to availability of places, welcomes non-Catholic children whose parents wish to see them educated in a Christian environment.\r\n\r\nOur Mission Statement reflects our aim to provide every child with the opportunity to develop their full potential in an orderly and caring atmosphere. The school is within the Surrey LA and has Specialist School status. We have been  a Technology College since 1995 and in September 2009 have been granted a second specialism as a Music College, in recognition of our achievements to date. We are also designated as a Lead School for Gifted and Talented students",
