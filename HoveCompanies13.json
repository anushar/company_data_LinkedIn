NYTW is committed to the development of innovative theatre by supporting theatre artists at all stages of their careers, providing an environment where work can be created free from the artistic compromise and forbidding financial demands often associated with commercial ventures. Over the past two decades, NYTW has evolved to become a significant force in New York City's vibrant cultural landscape and is now recognized as one of the leading producing theatres of original work in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Workshop places the artist at the center of its mission, and, as a result, the work developed and produced here is aesthetically, thematically, and methodologically diverse. During the course of a season, audiences can engage with an eclectic mix of theatre, including full-scale musicals, bare-bones readings, and multimedia productions. NYTW is renowned for producing intelligent and complex plays that expand the boundaries of theatrical form and in some new and compelling way address issues that are critical to our times. The Workshop boasts a long list of acclaimed work that includes Tony Kushner's Slavs! and Homebody/Kabul, Martha Clarke's KAOS and Vienna: Lusthaus (revisited), Caryl Churchill's Mad Forest, Far Away and A Number, Jonathan Larson's Rent, Athol Fugard's My Children! My Africa!, John Guare's Lydie Breeze, Doug Wright's Quills, Claudia Shear's Blown Sideways Through Life and Dirty Blonde, and Ivo van Hove's productions of A Streetcar Named Desire and Hedda Gabler.
