    "description": "Founded in 1839, Sussex County Cricket Club is the oldest professional sports club in the world. \r\n\r\nThe club played cricket at 3 locations in Brighton & Hove before finding it's current home on Eaton Road in 1871. Our first fixture at the County Ground was against Gloucestershire on 6th June 1872.\r\n\r\nThe Club won its first County Championship in 2003, which was the beginning of an era in which Sussex enjoyed prolonged success, named 'The Golden Decade'\r\n\r\nSussex had tasted one-day success in 1963, 1964, 1978 and 1986 but 'The Golden Decade' is regarded as the most successful period in the long history, with Sussex reclaiming the County Championship in both 2006 and 2007, as well as making 2006 a 'double' winning year, with the County also winning the C&G Trophy in a thrilling low-scoring final at Lord's against Lancashire.\r\n\r\nSussex also embarked on one-day success, winning the Pro40 League in both 2008 and 2009, the latter also inspiring the Club to a first Twenty20 title, beating Somerset on Finals Day at Edgbaston. \r\n\r\nWe now pride ourselves on not only delivering first class County cricket but following the 3 year redevelopment of the ground here in Hove, we now offer a wide range of first class facilities for local business and the community to utilise 12 months of the year.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Sussex CCC visit\r\nwww.sussexcricket.co.uk\r\nwww.facebook.com/sussexccc\r\nwww.twitter.com/sussexccc",

We are experts in call handling and professional virtual receptionist solutions. Our virtual receptionist solutions offer businesses, regardless of their size, an alternative way of handling their telephone calls and unlike the majority of our competitors we charge per call not per minute so you are not caught out with large unexpected bills.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate the difference a team of enthusiastic and motivated staff can make to customer satisfaction and ultimately retention. We are not a call centre and so our customers are not simply numbers. We instead are a series of small teams each dedicated to a limited number of customers. As a result, each of our customers and their callers receive an outstanding personal service. Our customers also have their own account manager who is on hand to discuss and address their virtual receptionist needs whenever they want.\r\n\r\nOur staff (who we call virtual receptionists) are professional and skilled call handling agents who answer inbound telephone calls in your business name as an overflow or outsourced service. Our virtual receptionists can offer far more than just a message taking service. Other services include (but are not limited to): call patching, appointment booking, order taking, outbound calling, etc...",
