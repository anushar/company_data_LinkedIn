With a reputation for consistently delivering great steaks and unique flavours led them to a larger store in South Yarra where we are still located today. \r\n\r\nThe success of the Squires Loft formula and demand for Squires Loft branded products developed substantial interest from staff and customers who wanted to duplicate the business. This has resulted in 13 steakhouse restaurants operating, Seven under the Squires Loft banner.\r\n\r\nThese steakhouses are located around Melbourne, Country Victoria, Brisbane, Gold Coast and Western Australia. Further steakhouses are in the pipeline and there is significant interest, which has lead to the most recent restaurant, located on Whitehorse Road in Nunawading",
