We are also thrilled at the prospect of collaborating with other microbreweries on exciting one-off projects, and believe us when we say we\u2019ve got some great ideas for this. \r\n\r\nIn addition to brewing our own range of beers, our wholesale business means that we are able to provide our customers with an unparalleled range of beer from some of the UK's most exciting breweries; many of the beers would otherwise be unavailable to order as single casks, if at all in the South East region.\r\n\r\nBrighton Bier merged with Franklins Brewery and specialist cask and craft wholesaler WithSoul.",

These comedy courses aren\u2019t just for aspiring comedians; they are for anyone who wants to;\r\n\u25feImprove their confidence                                                             \r\n\u25feEnhance their public speaking ability\r\n\u25feIncrease their presentation skills\r\n\r\nAll courses are taught in a relaxed and encouraging atmosphere.

In other words, the natural comedic talents of the individual are developed by learning through doing practical exercises and experience backed up with theory. This approach relies on motivated individuals, close group interaction (rather than impersonal classes) and the natural talents and deep industry experience of Brighton Comedy Course. BCC also believes in delivering a course that allows each student to have the necessary time to perform and to have constructive, personalised feedback on every session. For this reason there is a maximum of 12 attendees in a class.\r\n\r\nFor more details www.brightoncomedycourse.com"
