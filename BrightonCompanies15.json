    "description": "We are Greedy Gull Studios, a small indie developer based in Brighton formed in 2013. The studio consists of four students from the University of Brighton studying Computer Science (Games). \r\nThe idea to create a studio stemmed from the need to do an industrial placement during our third year of study. As we looked around at the various places that were available to us none of them were quite right, we wanted to be able to be creatively free and work in areas that we were passionate about, therefore we came up with the idea of creating our own company  as a placement opportunity. \r\nAnd thus Greedy Gull Studios was born!"
