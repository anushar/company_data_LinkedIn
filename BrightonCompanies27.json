Last year, our pass rate was 99%, with 83% of students achieving merit or distinction.\r\n\r\nWe build language exercises around trips to many of the country\u2019s most famous landmarks. Places like Canterbury, Cambridge, Oxford, Brighton and Stratford-upon-Avon are all on the itinerary \u2013 depending on the centre. There are also regular excursions into London, which include an educational tour of great museums combined with the opportunity to do some shopping in Oxford Street, Covent Garden or Knightsbridge. Depending on the centre, there\u2019ll be some splendid sightseeing with a ride on the London Eye, a cruise on the River Thames or the opportunity for a tour on an open top bus.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoons, teachers and specialist staff organise a whole host of activities such as volleyball, tennis, badminton, basketball, squash, table-tennis, football, softball, swimming and water polo.

    "description": "Bags by Troy, which operates under the Troy Sunshade Company (ASI/92252) name, is celebrating more than 125 years in business. Our products are made with pride by our employees in Greenville, Ohio, USA. Since 1887, we have always believed in good, old fashioned customer service. Our customers are our number one priority. In fact, our office does not have voice mail, meaning all inbound telephone calls are answered by a live company representative. We work closely with our customers to insure every order is produced to specification.\r\n\r\nIt was 1887 when Frank Douglass and Gus Stouder from Troy, OH, began manufacturing sunshades for carriages and called their business The Troy Carriage Sunshade Company. Their line eventually came to include sun visors, umbrellas and similar items, as well as metal hubcaps. When automobiles came into mass production, they also started producing windshields.\r\n\r\nAs World War II raged, the company did its part by supplying windshields for army trucks and components for generators and welders, while rebuilding interiors of worn-out aircraft cylinders.\r\n\r\nIn 1982, the company relocated from Troy to Greenville, OH. Ten years later, Troy Sunshade Company acquired Strayer Coin Bag Company of New Brighton, PA. In October 1999, the company officially joined the Advertising Specialty Institute and now it operates with 30 employees. No longer does Troy Sunshade Company produce carriage sunshades, though it has kept the original name. The leading force of Troy Sunshade Company is now the Bags by Troy line.",
