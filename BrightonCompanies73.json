PPC was founded in 2009 to assist alternative investment fund managers create and execute fixed-term marketing campaigns to raise capital from investors.  PPC broke the mold by eliminating the \"success fee / long term contract\" business model in favor of fixed term, 3 month marketing campaign subscription service. Over the years, many fund managers have asked BHA to combine its investor research and lead-generation capabilities with a hands-on, direct marketing service. Lacking the time and infrastructure to target BHA\u2019s investor leads, countless fund managers often requested PPC expand its offering.",

Founded by Ben Lovett (Mumford and Sons), Kevin Jones (Cherbourg) and producer Ian Grimble, it grew into a community of musicians, industry and fans alike, and provided a platform for the newest bands on London\u2019s circuit. The night has seen the likes of Noah and the Whale, Laura Marling, Mumford and Sons, JJ Pistolet and Peggy Sue grace the stage and has become closely associated with the nu-folk movement in the capital. As well as this, it helped spawn the careers of artists such as Esser, The Holloways and Example, in keeping with the eclectic ethos that Communion has come to stand for.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 after regular sell out nights, Communion was asked to be on the committee for the Camden Crawl and launched a sister night in Brighton, first at the Hanbury Ballrooms and then at The Albert. There are now also club nights at The Adelphi in Leeds and in Sydney, Australia. Communion Records was founded in September of 2009 and aims to continue the club night\u2019s all encompassing philosophy and championing of new talent.",

Search engines do not employ an army of people to read and categorize each website they find.  To determine how your website might be a great answer in a search engine results page (SERP) they send out small programs to research (or crawl) through your website.  These programs (called robots or spiders) read every word of each page, follow all of your links and then report back to the search engine on the words they find.  Search engines then have a copy or \"index\" of your website stored away for quick reference when a search request is made.  If all goes well, there is a great match between what a users asks, and what the search engine finds on its copy of your website.\r\n\r\nImage or Flash driven websites are almost impossible to \"read\" by a search engine and therefore rarely show up as a good result when a search engine query is made.  Search engine optimization is a balance between website content, link building, and keyword research. \r\n\r\n    * Keyword Research\r\n    * Link Building Services\r\n    * Promotional and/or Search Engine Writing\r\n    * Search Engine Friendly Web Design\r\n    * Directory Submission Services"

    "description": "The Invitation Book is a discount voucher and savings directory that can help you save hundreds of pounds on going out in your area. It is published annually in 9 regional editions. Each book is packed with a multitude of significant discounts (2 for 1, 25% off, etc) for the best local leisure, entertainment and dining establishments.\r\n\r\nThe Invitation Book and all associated products are produced by Invitation Media Ltd., with head offices based in Bristol.\r\n\r\nThe company was set up in 2003 by publishers Scott Davidson, Sam Oliphant, Dougal Templeton and Jo Kennedy, with the aim of raising over \u00a31 million for good causes in every region that has an Invitation book. A secondary target was to have a book established in every major city and region throughout the UK and in 2008 there were books in the following areas:\r\n\r\nBristol, Bath & West \r\nCoventry & Warwickshire \r\nBirmingham, Solihull & West Midlands \r\nCardiff, Newport & South Wales \r\nNottingham & Derby \r\nThe Black Country \r\nIn 2009, the following editions are available:\r\n\r\nSouthampton & Portsmouth \r\nBrighton, Hove & West Sussex \r\nReading, Oxford & The Thames Valley \r\nAs with anything new, it does take time for people to get used to the idea that you really can buy \u00a31,000's worth of fantastic offers and savings for less than \u00a330\u2026 but believe us, there are no catches, no hidden costs or prohibitive terms and conditions.\r\n\r\nWe would love to claim this as an original concept. But like all great ideas, it's inspired by others. There are many similar books around the world but it's 'Entertainment' founded in Detroit, USA by Hughes and Sheila Potiker in 1962, which is the most successful. It's now published in more than 200 markets across Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Asia with more than 8 million books sold in 2004. As well as each book delivering $1,000's in voucher and dining savings, it also works as a community fundraiser - $90 million was raised last year for local good causes from the sale of USA 'Entertainment' books alone.\r\n\r\nHaving recently moved to larger offices in Bristol and with a dedicated and hardworking team, Invitation Media Ltd. continues to expand its client database of members, discount promotion partners and fundraisers, always with the clear aim of helping make a difference in the local community.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in the book, or ways in which we can help you, why don't you make an appointment and come have a coffee and chat, we would be more than happy to see you."

    "description": "Be At One was founded in 1998 by three well-seasoned bar tenders who were determined to bring back fantastic customer service and consistency to the cocktail bar trade, particularly after the arrival of design rather than customer-led style bars.\r\n\r\nBe At One understood the need for something a little bit different; somewhere the guests could rely on a warm greeting, great drinks and a place where a handshake and classic tunes were more important than a design feature.\r\n\r\nIn May 1998 Be At One, Battersea opened its doors, situated on Battersea Rise just near the Northcote Road Junction. The bar was an instant success, offering something new to the area and providing an inviting and friendly atmosphere for the buzzing twenty-something's to let their hair down.\r\n\r\nOver the past fifteen years, the Be At One chain has gone from strength to strength opening a further 19 bars across London, Reading and Brighton with further expansion taking place in Bristol and Milton Keynes.",
