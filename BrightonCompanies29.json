We have nurtured our philosophy of freshness, high-quality and value by learning from this dual perspective. We have applied this experience to enable us to grow in two short years into a rapidly expanding brand which supplies our smoothies to businesses stretching from independent boutiques, to large hotel chains, and world-famous sites such as Brighton Pier.\r\n\r\nUrban Quench grew from a smoothie and juice bar in Reigate called Urban Kitchen. Having spent years experimenting with different fruity concoctions and dealing with the obstacles involved in ensuring our customers were guaranteed fantastic smoothies every time, we finally (after many years of trial, error, and practice) came up with the our quality and delicious recipes. Having perfected our smoothies, we felt that it was our duty to share our secrets and enable other businesses to serve the best smoothies too: Quench was born!"
