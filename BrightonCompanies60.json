    "description": "The Gatwick Diamond Initiative is an economic partnership free to businesses.   Business leaders work with the local authorities and government agencies to address the economic needs of the area to ensure it is a world class place to do business.   \r\n\r\nIn 2003, the Gatwick Diamond Initiative started when businesses got together to recognise the economic strengths of the area by creating an identity, calling it the Gatwick Diamond. The \u2018Gatwick Diamond\u2019 is not trademarked and can be used by any business in the area. The Gatwick Diamond encompasses the council areas of Epsom & Ewell, Mole Valley, Reigate & Banstead, Crawley, Horsham, Mid Sussex and Tandridge.\r\n\r\nThe Gatwick Diamond Initiative lobbies government and the public sector on issues that prevent businesses in the area from growing; we encourage international trade; we promote, attract and help UK and foreign inward investors looking to locate in the area; we campaign on issues ; we encourage the three FE colleges at Redhill, Crawley and Epsom to work together with the University of Brighton and University of the Creative Arts to provide a greater Higher and Further Education offer that meets business needs; and we send out press releases and strong messages about how great an area the Gatwick Diamond is to live and work in.   The Gatwick Diamond Initiative is also a part of the government sponsored Coast to Capital Local Enterprise Partnership.",

    "description": "I am not what most people would consider to be an average photographer. Armed with a selection of compact film cameras, I never leave home without one and I am always ready to capture anything that happens around me.\r\n\r\nIn October 2008 my first solo book Hot Shots was released in the UK, it sold out its UK and US print runs in under a year.  It is an instructional book for everyday people and is intended to help them sex up their photography, without being too bogged down in technical jargon.\r\n\r\nI now teach a Photography course based around the book, I run the course from Brighton but it has also taken place in beautiful sea side towns of San Francisco and Hastings. Read more about the course here.\r\n\r\nI have also had work published in two Lomo photographic books, one called \u201cSpirit\u201d and the other, \u201cDon\u2019t Think Just Shoot.\u201d My work has also featured in a range of publications including Photo Pro Magazine, DSLR user magazine, Olympus User Magazine, Russian Esquire, Sonntagszeitung, and the BBC news website. I was a regular contributor to JPG magazine from when it first launched in 2005. In 2006 I was on the panel of judges in New York for flickr.com\u2019s \u201cBlink of the Eye\u201d photo competition and judged again in 2008 for pixish.com\u2019s \u201cThe SXSW Gallery Show\u201d competition. I work commercially as a photographer for a range of different clients which have included Phillips, The Times, The Commonwealth Games 2002, Dr Martens, Stomp and Imogen Heap."

    "description": "tilt is a multi-disciplined digital agency based in the heart of Brighton. We have a closely integrated team of highly talented individuals whose experience spans many disciplines as well as many sectors. We believe the old style agency model doesn\u2019t work as well as it should, so to stay ahead of the curve, we need to be relatively small and flexible; ensuring that we can best meet your needs.\r\n\r\nOur Philosophy\r\nHere\u2019s one simple rule about Tilt: if you can\u2019t make good stuff, you can\u2019t work here. We simply do not employ people who do not have a creative background. We believe that every aspect of an agency\u2019s work MUST be creative in some way (well, perhaps with the exception of the accounting). We need project managers. But we need Project Managers who are sensitive to the creative process. We need Account Directors \u2013 but not just Account Directors who care about the bottom line. \r\n\r\nMaybe we\u2019re na\u00efve but this is what we believe: If you put creativity first, all the time, every time, it pays off. \r\n\r\nOur Capabilities\r\nHere\u2019s the tricky thing about digital \u2013 you need to be truly multi-disciplined to make it work. This is where we believe Tilt excels. We create integrated experiences and open channels for conversations that keep humans connected to brands. We develop holistic platforms and ecosystems that help brands become a lovable part of their audience\u2019s everyday lives and we believe these solutions are great value for money.",
