    "description": "Born London, England, 1978 \r\nLives & works in London\r\n\r\n\r\nStatement\r\n\r\nJamie Lau\u2019s practice uses photography, video and sculpture, to explore ideas around anxiety, in the form of inertia, impermanence and disorientation. His work often involves re-contextualising landscapes and objects, through intervention or subverting their original meaning, purpose or function. He is interested in the \u2018decisive moment\u2019 within narratives, and the drama and uncertainty that belongs to that specific space and time. It\u2019s this uncertainty, and anticipation of what is to come that is inherent within his exploration of anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn his videos Respire and Tunnel, Lau explores anxieties over drowning and falling asleep whilst driving, a theme echoed in his photographic series Car Crash Flowers which documented wilting and decomposing roadside tributes. For the series The Dark Ages he presents fast food restaurants isolated in black limbo spaces, glowing like beacons in the night. Set adrift like ships on a black sea they become pockets of recognition within an uncertain terrain. He is currently working on a new body of sculptural work that questions cultural meaning inherent within architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nMA Fine Art Sculpture\r\nThe Slade School of Fine Art\r\n2009 \u2013 2012\r\n\r\nBA (Hons) Critical Fine Art Practice\r\nUniversity of Brighton\r\n(First Class)\r\n1998 \u2013 2001",

During her time in the Big Smoke she gained an abundance of transferable skills within the design industry, working for gift and homeware designers including Lisa Stickley and Gisela Graham. At the end of 2012 she made the bold move to return to her northern roots and relocate back to the steel city of Sheffield to focus on martha and hepsie ltd and develop her freelance design career; Made by Martha. \r\n\r\nHepsie \r\nHepsie gained experience from work placements at Matthew Williamson, Copperwheat Blundell and trends agency The Bureaux during her ,Fashion and Business Studies degree at Brighton and progressed a marketing career with one of the UK\u2019s leading sterling silver jewellery brands Kit Heath.

We believe in providing more than just a good night out. Our website aims to provide a service for the community that has built up around the Sintillate nights. \r\n\r\nSINTILLATE - Nightclub Promoters followed up their success in London by launching in MARBELLA in 2003, MANCHESTER in 2004, LIVERPOOL, LEEDS and SHARM EL SHEIKH in 2005, BRIGHTON and BIRMINGHAM in 2007, IBIZA and DUBAI in 2008, BRISTOL, SHEFFIELD, LEAMINGTON SPA and DERBY in 2009 and in TENERIFE and NOTTINGHAM in 2010.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 SINTILLATE won 'Best Promoter' at the London Club and Bar Awards, then again in 2008 Sintillate took the top award, this time for the 'UK's Best Promoter' at the London Club and Bar Awards.",

We work with carefully selected local installers to negotiate great prices on domestic solar photovoltaic installations in different areas. At the minute we manage solar clubs which cover East Sussex, Brighton & Lewes, and Tunbridge Wells. Although we're based on the club/group buying concept, in fact you can register as an individual and take advantage of the same prices on solar installations without having to wait for others in your community or town to join. We also act as a free, independent portal for other solar buying groups around the country who would like to attract more members.",
