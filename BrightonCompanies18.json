The charity successfully raised enough money to ensure that Brighton was one of the first places in the country to have a ventilator designed for premature babies.\r\n\r\nWe are best known today for our work with the new Royal Alexandra Children\u2019s Hospital and our continued support of the Trevor Mann Baby Unit. However, we also raise money for life-saving medical equipment in a number of local hospitals, as well as providing much-needed sensory play areas for children with disabilities.  \r\n\r\nWe do not receive any government funding and so we rely on the generous support of individuals, community groups, companies and trusts.",
