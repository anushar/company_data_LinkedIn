They are usually made of pure titanium and are small root shaped structures which are placed gently and carefully into the bone. \r\n\r\nCOSMETIC DENTISTRY - This includes tooth whitening, veneers, cosmetic bonding ( used to reshape individual teeth, close very small gaps and repair slight defects such as chipped teeth ), ceramic inlays and onlays ( tooth coloured porcelain fillings, bonded into or over a broken-down tooth ).\r\n\r\nCROWNS & BRIDGES - A crown is used to protect and restore a broken or heavily filled tooth and a bridge is used to replace a missing tooth.\r\n\r\nPREVENTATIVE DENTISTRY - we believe in preventing problems rather than just treating them as they occur, so routine appointents every 6 months are recommended.\r\n\r\nX-RAYS - They will show up any signs of tooth decay and bone loss.\r\n\r\nROOT CANAL TREATMENTS - (or endodontics) means removing damaged or dead pulp and filling the space with a special filling material.",
