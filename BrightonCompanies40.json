From the sobering duty of Commission for Social Care Inspection \u2013 to the splendour of Shakepeares\u2019s Globe Theatre. For each, we\u2019ve developed creative and beautiful campaigns that demand attention and typify the zeitgeist that reflects the cultural diversity of the society we all enjoy today.\r\n\r\nThe Scarlet team understand the value of the Arts and Culture as part of an integrated public service: that\u2019s why we\u2019ve chosen to work in it for twenty years.  We need a committed platform to roll-out cultural heritage to all those within our lives.  The challenges needed are a direct representation of the way we enable access and work within our social framework.
