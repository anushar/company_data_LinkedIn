They come from all over the world: France, Denmark, Spain, Australia, Russia, Japan (some come from China, of course). We work with local artists and artisans and stock beautiful postcards, prints, t-shirts, games, sweets and jewellery created by them.\r\n\r\nWe are very DIY oriented that\u2019s why we stock and use art supplies and art sets from DJECO, KIDSONROOF, Japanese washi tapes and activity books from ANORAK. We\u2019ve got lots of clay, coloured sands, paint, origami/kirigami sets, beads, stamps and everything one needs to make their own kite.\r\n\r\nDid we say we love science? Yes, we do. At rocket science you\u2019ll find books filled with experiments, giant microbes, encyclopaedias, microscopes and telescopes, horrible science kits, space shuttles and even astronaut ice-cream (from NASA headquarters).\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve got a nice selection of beautifully designed board games.\r\n\r\nOur games are for ages 2 to 99, and 2 of them are created by local artists and thinkers.\r\n\r\nWe love to read (and talk in different languages), that\u2019s why we stock books and children\u2019s magazines (ANORAK and OKIDO) in different languages."

But what exactly is a silent disco\u2026.?\r\n\r\nA silent disco is unlike any other experience for one simple, but very important reason: absolutely no music is played aloud. Sometimes referred to as a \u201cheadphone party\u201d or a \u201cheadphone disco\u201d, all the party-goers slip-on a pair of the wireless headphones, which we provide. They then listen to music transmitted to the headphones from your chosen source \u2013 whether that is a live DJ or an alternative source, such as an IPod, MP3 Player or Laptop. Another advantage is that these headphones can be switched between two separate channels, providing your guests the opportunity to decide what they would rather listen to \u2013 an option not available at your average party! So, while half your guests are enjoying 80s cheese that is playing on channel \u201cA\u201d and dancing to the Y-M-C-A, the other half can be rocking out to Nirvana on channel \u201cB\u201d \u2013 the choice is theirs!"
