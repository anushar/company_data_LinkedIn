The original band is the 12 piece Big Buzzard Boogie Band playing great swing/blues/funk/latin & soul, at places from the high class and swanky to the most basic you can possibly imagine, and being equally at home in them all. These have included London's 100 Club, The Famous Spiegeltent at the Edinburgh and Brighton Festivals, Buckingham Palace for the Queen's Golden Jubilee proms, The opening of the New Sadlers Wells Theatre, The Soho Ball, staff Christmas parties and other events at the Royal Festival Hall, as well as back gardens, bars, festivals and weddings all over the country.\r\n\r\nIt's run by Andy Williamson, saxophonist, singer and sometimes chef. He is active in jazz , choral and classical music, plus various flavours of folk and world music. He's adepts at combining these in unusual ways. Fro example, last year, he put together all of the music for a wedding involving English, indian and Jewish families - the results included a jazz quintet, a jewish wedding band, a recital by a world class tabla player who then joined the Big Buzzard band for a bangra flavoured version of their set.\r\n\r\nWe have a laid back, friendly approach, and our musicians are all the kind of people you'd like to have as guests at any event - friendly and considerate. They also happen to be some of the most talented in the business. Do get in touch."

Over the years our commissions have grown from private houses to large international schemes.\r\n\r\nWe have undertaken numerous private house commissions ranging from refurbishment and extensions to large new build houses for which we have gained national recognition and received many awards.\r\n\r\nThe educational sector is a field currently undergoing major development with support from both local and national government. We have extensive experience designing primary schools and we have also designed university buildings. The practice regularly works with 1991 RIBA Gold Medal winner Prof. Sir Colin Stansfield Smith, a prominent consultant on educational buildings.\r\n\r\nWith increasing pressure on urban re-generation and infrastructure improvements in city centres, large mixed-use schemes and master planning have become other important areas of work. We regularly work as part of a team of architects providing design services for schemes in London, Cambridge, Dublin and America. We have specialist experience working with modern listed buildings and have been involved with intricate change of use projects in Dublin, St. Albans, Brighton and London.\r\n\r\nBeing a relatively small practice, we can offer clients a personal service with the involvement of our directors at all stages of the design process."
