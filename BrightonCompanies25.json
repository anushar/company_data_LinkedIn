With offices based in Brighton, Filthy Sky is a music, television and digital content company.\r\n \r\nThe idea to start the company originated from Jimmy wanting to be entirely self-contained giving him the freedom to work on music and television productions without the creative restrictions placed upon people by some of the large music and media companies. Over the years, Jimmy has worked with some truly talented individuals from the world of media and music and decided that he would build his own team so he could work on projects from start to finish, without having to answer to anyone but himself. This has given him a huge amount of creative freedom.\r\n\r\nFilthy Sky Records is the trading name for the music side of Filthy Sky Ltd. We are a refreshing independent record label releasing high quality dance music across all genres. We shall be bringing you the freshest and most unique songs from both the commercial and the underground world, ranging from international stars to brand new up and coming talent. At Filthy Sky Records we care about our artists and help them to succeed in their music careers. We have a massive range of services and advice available if needed, to help with the artists\u2019 production and DJ journey giving them the best chance to succeed in a very hard industry. \r\n \r\nAt Filthy Sky we aim to help young up and coming talent to break in to the world of TV and music while also helping out established stars in their journey though the world of entertainment. We're also looking in to starting up workshops for young people in the very near future, mixing education with fun and bringing music and TV production in to places where you wouldn\u2019t expect to see it.\r\n \r\nWatch this space, there\u2019s a lot happening very soon!"
