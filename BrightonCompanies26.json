We are particularly concerned with understanding how collaboration can deliver high quality work placements that meet the needs of students and business. \r\n\r\nThrough our Talent 2030 programme we are encouraging more young women to consider careers in engineering and manufacturing. And we are exploring what the reality of a truly global jobs market means for students studying in the UK and for companies hiring graduates. \r\n\r\nA second key theme is maximising the value of the UK\u2019s strength in innovative research and development. \r\n\r\nThe Growing Value Project will continue to explore how to make the most of the nation\u2019s public research base while projects, such as London Creative and Digital Fusion and the Brighton Fuse, will pilot practical approaches to delivering productive relationships between university researchers and smaller creative, digital and IT companies.",
