Having spent three years as a photographer's assistant in London, I moved to Brighton in 1992 to set up my first studio and have never looked back.\r\n \r\nI work with a number of publishers, advertising, marketing, PR and design agencies for clients including Virgin Holidays, Parker Pens, P&O Ferries, Royal Bank of Scotland, The Body Shop, Francis Lincoln, Neil\u2019s Yard, Tektura, The Ivy Press and Peter Christian.\r\n\r\nI feel privileged to have worked with and retained some wonderful clients, many of whom have become great friends over the years. I like to think my clients appreciate my down-to-earth attitude and old fashioned work ethic - I recognize the importance of getting a job done, well, to specification and with a personable approach. I am proud of my ability to build a rapport with my subjects whether they are professional models, members of the public or most recently a host of unruly animals for the interestingly series of \u2018beautiful\u2019 books.\r\nI am passionate about photography and I hope that is obvious from my work, whatever the subject might be, as I always have a genuine enthusiasm to create something unique. Over the years my style and experience has developed hugely but my core strength has always been working with light, whether natural or artificial \u2013 I find it fascinating and both a technical and creative challenge - one that I will never tire of.",
