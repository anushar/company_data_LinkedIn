    "description": "Art and Cartoons by Sophie Grillet.\r\nSophie is an English artist who for the past 17 years has been living in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  She mostly paints in oils and acrylics, also working in 3D including stone and clay sculpture, and photography.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Sophie takes on cartoon commissions, having been a successful cartoonist for books, magazines and national newspapers in the U.K., where she was a regular contributor to The Guardian newspaper.  Sophie attended Central School of Art (now University of the Arts, London) and is an arts graduate of the University of Brighton.\r\n\r\nSophie is a currently docent at the UoM Museum of Art (UMMA) where she provides tours for children and for adults, from university student groups with faculty to older adults suffering memory loss.\r\n\r\nBeing insatiably curious, Sophie is working on a grand attempt to integrate her interests in art, social justice, emotion, ecology, science, and math, but the journey has just begun. She likes to be mindful that what science seeks to describe, is Nature.  Her work reflects on the tragedy of our love of natural beauty and our haste to destroy it."
