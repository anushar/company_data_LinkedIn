    "description": "Colorado Credit Union was chartered in 1973 when about 35 Johns Manville employees gathered their funds together and started the credit union, a member owned financial cooperative. We grew rapidly, serving only employees, retirees and family members of Johns Manville. In 1998, we decided to open our membership to other employer groups and associations, realizing the need to grow and help more people with their finances.\r\n\r\nWe changed our name from Johns Manville Credit Union to Colorado Credit Union in 2005, to better reflect our diverse membership. We continue to be the bank of choice for the majority of Johns Manville employees and retirees. We've also become the primary financial institution for thousands of other people as well.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, we merged Brighton Federal Credit Union into CCU. This credit union was founded in 1954 by local teachers and continues to focus on the needs of its teacher members. This allowed us to become part of the Brighton and surrounding area communities. This change brought 1,800 new members to experience what great member service is about. This addition brought with it the 27J teachers and students, the City of Brighton, Platte Valley Medical Center and several large area churches. \r\n\r\nColorado Credit Union has nearly the highest ratio of assets and loan balances per member of any credit union our size in the U.S. We help many people with their borrowing needs as well as helping people accumulate wealth with our outstanding savings products.",
