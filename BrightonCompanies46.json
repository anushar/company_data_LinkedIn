    "description": "Mr Bongo started life in 1989 as a small record shop underneath Daddy Kool\u2019s Reggae Store on Berwick Street in London.  It was the first shop to sell vinyl releases from independent hip hop labels such as Def Jam, Rawkus, Nervous and Big Beat outside of the USA.  It also established itself as the standard bearer for hard-to-find, classic Latin music, particularly Brazilian, outside of the Americas.\r\n\r\nOver the following years it moved three times within Soho and opened in Shibuya, Japan. Mr Bongo moved its offices to Brighton in 1999 and closed all shops in 2003 to turn its focus online.\r\n\r\nThe label now has a recording roster featuring some of the best Brazilian, Latin, reggae, African and Jazz music by artists including Terry Callier, Jorge Ben, Seu Jorge, Prince Fatty, Incredible Bongo Band and Marcos Valle.  \r\n\r\nMr Bongo has a publishing arm with an in-house team that produces and licenses music for use by third parties including advertising, film and TV companies worldwide; brands such as Bacardi, Nike, Adidas, Fosters, Nissan and Guinness have used Mr Bongo music.  They also deal with worldwide royalty collection for artists and organizations.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Mr Bongo began releasing films, a venture that grew to compliment the music.  In keeping with the record labels philosophy, titles are carefully selected and sourced from around the world and now include essential works by esteemed directors including as Scorsese, Coppola, Has, Bertolucci, Rocha and Dovzhenko amongst others.",

That they help frame the conversation, and encourage informed debate and decision-making.\r\n\r\nBut we also recognize that the traditional newspaper model doesn\u2019t work in the age of the Internet.  And this issue is even more acute when it comes to local news.  Many communities are facing the prospect of life without a local paper.\r\n\r\nBut while the Internet creates problems for the traditional model of local journalism, it also creates opportunities for a new kind of newspaper that can play the same critical democratic role \u2013 perhaps even more effectively.\r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s why we started the Austin Post \u2013 a not-for-profit, community-centric newspaper that leverages the very same technology changes that have created the so-called \u201ccrisis of journalism.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe Austin Post is a venture of the Trilogy Employee Foundation, the charitable arm of Trilogy Enterprises \u2013 one of Austin\u2019s first and longest-lived technology firms.  We have a small team led by Trilogy President Scott Brighton and our Editor, Karie Meltzer.  Feel free to reach out to either of us with thoughts, suggestions, or frustrations at scott@austinpost.org and karie@austinpost.org."
